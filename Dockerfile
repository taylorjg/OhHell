# We are deploying to render.com which seems to want the Docker image to be built for a specific platform:
#   "The provided image URL points to an image with an invalid platform. Images must be built with the platform linux/amd64."
# I tried to build like this:
#   docker build --tag ohhell-amd64:v5 --platform=linux/amd64 .
#Â but it hangs at the "RUN dotnet restore" step.
# After some research, I found a workaround:
#   https://forums.docker.com/t/dotnet-restore-never-completes-on-m1-mac-when-targeting-linux-amd64-platform/132337/8
# I now build like this:
#   docker buildx build --force-rm --tag taylorjg/ohhell:v6 .
